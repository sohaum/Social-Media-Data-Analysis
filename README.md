## Overview

Social media platforms rely heavily on data analysis to understand user preferences and improve content strategies. This project simulates social media data and applies Python-based tools for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing engagement trends.

## Features

- Generate random data for dates, categories, and engagement metrics.
- Clean the dataset by removing duplicates and handling invalid entries.
- Visualize engagement trends using histograms and boxplots.
- Perform statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights.
- Summarize findings with actionable recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset is generated programmatically with the following fields:

- **Date**: A sequence of dates for the simulated dataset.
- **Category**: Content categories such as Food, Travel, Music, etc.
- **Likes**: Randomly generated engagement metrics.

### Sample data:

| Date       | Category | Likes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| 2021-01-01 | Travel   | 4500  |
| 2021-01-02 | Food     | 3800  |

## Project Workflow

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Use Python libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
2. **Generate Random Data**: Simulate a dataset with random engagement metrics across various categories.
3. **Load and Clean Data**:
    - Remove duplicates and null values.
    - Convert data fields to appropriate formats.
4. **Visualize Data**:
    - Histogram to display the distribution of likes.
    - Boxplot to compare engagement across categories.
5. **Analyze Data**:
    - Compute overall average likes.
    - Calculate mean likes for each category.
6. **Conclusions**:
    - Identify high-performing and low-performing categories.
    - Provide recommendations based on insights.

## Results and Conclusions

### Key Findings

- **Average Likes**: 4968.63
- **Top Category**: Travel (5624.46 average likes)
- **Lowest Category**: Culture (4559.78 average likes)

### Recommendations

- Focus on high-performing categories such as Travel, Fashion, and Music.
- Explore strategies to improve engagement in Culture and Fitness categories.
- Leverage data-driven insights to refine content strategies.

## Technologies Used
